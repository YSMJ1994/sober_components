This project was bootstrapped with [Create React UI](https://github.com/YSMJ1994/create-react-ui).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the doc devServer in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The doc page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the doc and the library for production to the `build-doc` and `build-library` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React UI Library Document in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
It will correctly build your project into a releasable UI component library

The doc build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your doc is ready to be deployed!
Your library is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
